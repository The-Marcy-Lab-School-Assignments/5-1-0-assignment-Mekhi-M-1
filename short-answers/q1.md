# Question

What is the difference between how instance methods/properties and class methods/properties are created? What is the difference between how they are used?

# Answer

Class methods and properties are defined using the `static` keyword while instance methods and properties are defined without that keyword. Class methods and properties can only be accessed through the class itself (ex. `ClassName.getAll()`). For instance methods and properties, you must access them on an instance of the class (ex. `instanceOfClassName.name`).
